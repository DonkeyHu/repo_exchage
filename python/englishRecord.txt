The purpose of this jira is to separate the feature of websocket  from flinkmrg-svc. In order to make the flinkmgr-svc  component more single and focus on flink, we detach some feature as independent component. The acceptance criteria of the jira is that flink UI can query deploy event by this new component. Let me show the demo. This feature didn't work before, but now it's working again. You can see that this data comes from a new component. The new websocket connection API in here. The websocket in FASTAPI lib is async, you need to use await/async. Then seek the Kafka's data from minutes ago.

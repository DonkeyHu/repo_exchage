Today, I want to introduce this Jira, team quotas analysis report. The pain point is that at openshift cluster level we have lots of remaining resources, but at team quotas level, we don't have enough 
resource for users to apply for. So what cause this happened? The root cause is that team of user has allocated too many resources but not used. So we decide to make a analysis report to 
alert each of team.

Currently the report like this, the subject is ENV, team and team quotas analysis. The first part of the data summarizes the team quotas usage for each cluster.
If the running percentage is less than eighty percent, it means that the team resource allocation is unreasonable, should release out some resources. For example for datarisk team, on 39u, 
you can see the team allocate 1500 Gig bytes, but only used 700 Gig bytes.which cause lots of wastes.

The next recommendation for team of user is to delete inactive applications. You see report will filter the applications that has not been touched for 30 days. Thoese applications should be considering
deleted.

The last recommendation is to optimize deployment reources quotas. Below applications deploy with excessive resources, but the real running usage is quite low. So user should execute the operition
following the guide to optimize and redeploy their app.

That's all for this reports.
